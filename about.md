jeffkenton.com is an evolution of a number of more anonymizing blog sites. A Technician in the Studio, the Administrator's Apprentice, and a couple others before those are in that category. 

There is no need anymore to try to hide myself behind any euphemisms or *Noms de Plume* or whatever.

(Hardly anyone is paying any attention, anyway. I may as well be shouting into the wind! And I probably will!)

Enjoy your time here.

***Just for fun, I asked Gemini: "If someone told you that they had the "guts of a buffalo and the brains of a jackrabbit," what would that tell you about them, their attitude toward life, their relative robustness in the face of challenges"***

Gemini's response:

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what that tells you about them:

### The "Guts of a Buffalo"

This part of the phrase speaks to their core resilience and fortitude.

**Physical and Emotional Toughness:** A buffalo is a massive, powerful animal, built to withstand harsh prairie winters and predators. This person is telling you they are incredibly tough. They can take a metaphorical (or perhaps literal) punch and keep going. They have immense staying power and won't be easily broken by hardship, criticism, or failure.

**Deeply Resilient:** They can endure long periods of stress or difficulty. Like a buffalo plodding through a blizzard, they will put their head down and push through whatever comes their way. They have a deep well of inner strength.

**Courageous (but not necessarily strategic):** They are not afraid to face a problem head-on. They have the courage to confront difficult situations and won't shy away from a fight or a major challenge.

### The "Brains of a Jackrabbit"

This is the crucial, self-deprecating counterpoint. It describes their mental and strategic approach.

**Reactive and Instinctive:** A jackrabbit's brain is wired for immediate survival. It reacts to the slightest sound or movement with explosive speed. This person is telling you they operate on instinct and impulse rather than careful, long-term planning. They are likely to react first and think later.

**Prone to Anxiety or Panic:** Jackrabbits are famously skittish and nervous creatures. This person is admitting they can be easily startled, get flustered, and might panic when a problem first arises. Their initial response to a crisis is likely one of anxiety or frantic, unfocused energy.

**Short-Sighted:** Their focus is on the immediate threat or situation. They may be quick-witted in the moment, but they lack the ability to see the bigger picture, anticipate future consequences, or formulate a complex, multi-step plan. They solve the problem right in front of them, often without considering the one that will create down the road.

**Putting It All Together: Attitude and Robustness**

The combination of these two traits creates a fascinating and paradoxical character.

**Attitude Toward Life:** They likely live a very "in-the-moment" life. They don't overthink the future because it's not their strength. They are more likely to jump into a new venture or adventure with both feet, driven by courage, without fully considering the risks. They are doers, not planners. They might be seen as both incredibly brave and somewhat reckless.

**Relative Robustness in the Face of Challenges:** This is where the phrase is most telling.

- **Their Initial Reaction to Crisis:** When a challenge appears, the "jackrabbit brain" kicks in first. There might be a moment of panic, confusion, or a flurry of disorganized activity. They might make a few rash decisions based on gut feelings.

- **Their Ability to Endure the Crisis:** Once the initial shock wears off, the "buffalo guts" take over. Even if their initial reaction was messy and counterproductive, they have the raw endurance to outlast the problem. They will absorb the stress, handle the fallout from their own poor decisions, and simply refuse to quit.

*In essence, they are a survivor, but not an elegant one.* They won't navigate a crisis with grace and strategic genius. Instead, they will blunder through it, get knocked down a few times, but will always, inevitably, get back up and still be standing when the dust settles, ready for the next challenge.

You could trust this person to have your back in a crisis and to never abandon a tough job, but you probably wouldn't ask them to create the strategic plan for that job in the first place.
