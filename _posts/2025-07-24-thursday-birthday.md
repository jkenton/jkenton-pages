I'm a GEn X'er. INXS played around me a lot...

INXS - *Need You Tonight*


JMK: This one was rumored to have been written in 10 minutes (the lyrics anyway). I wonder if there is a setlist somewhere of songs that were written in one short session?

INXS - *The One Thing*

JMK: This was my anthem in 10th and 11th grade. *Shabooh Shoobah* was my favorite album for a long time.
