John Mayer - "Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967"

---

Walt Grace's Submarine Test reminds me of two separate decsriptions of folks who bore the complaints of their friends, telling them that they are crazy, and yet somehow overcame. Though in the first (chronologically) example, there were presumably no friends left afterward to drink to his honor.

*Dr Noah* from Mani Matter tells the story of Noah from the Bible and how his friends heard of his conversation with God about building an ark to save the animals from a giant flood.

*Kodoku: Sailing Alone Across the Pacific* from Kenichi Horie tells the story about his solo sailing venture from Japan to San Francisco in 1962. His friends and family never figured he coudl make it alone.

I wonder how often those guys' successes resulted in a difficulty getting help doing something straightforward or easy later in their lives. "Oh, so the great [insert name], who did the miraculous thing, needs *MY* help looking up a phone number?" I hope not.

Anyhow, those two additional stories came to mind the first time I heard *Walt Grace's Submarine Test*.
