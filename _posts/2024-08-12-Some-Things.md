1. "A mule with aspirations ain’t worth anything." - Bobby Lounge
2. You cannot hope to recover, unless you believe that it is possible to recover.
3. It is difficult to reason with someone who is willing to SAY ANYTHING that they are told to say.
4. It is difficult to content with someone who is willing to DO NOTHING in the face of everything that might be done to motivate them.
5. "The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read.” - Mark Twain


Perhaps the theme this week is to know - deep in your heart - that you cannot hope to change someone who doesn't want (or see the need) to change. And furthermore, to acknowledge that it may not be your place to affect the change in the first place.

Eyes front. Stay in your lane. Mind your Ps and Qs. Mind your own business, etc.
