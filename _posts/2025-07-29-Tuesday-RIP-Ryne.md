Famous physicist Murray Gell-Mann is supposed to have [suggested](http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm) that Richard Feynman solved problems with the following cutting edge technique:
	
> 	1. Write down the problem.
> 	2. Think real hard.
> 	3. Write down the solution.
	
Usually when people quote this, it’s to make a joke about how smart Feynman was. (If I tried this, I wouldn’t come up with quantum electrodynamics! I must not be able to think hard enough.) That’s one reading, but I prefer a different one.
