Because everyone was drinking like they needed to forget some horrible thing they'd done." -- Wright Thompson, *Pappyland*> "The Ole Miss band used to play a slow version of "Dixie" before the game, and even as I winced at the Confederate nostalgia, I also teared up because the song reminded me of my father. That's what Patterson Hood called the 'Duality of the Southern Thing'." -- Wright Thompson, *Pappyland*

I think Wright also wrote that NOSTALGIA is "home pain" from the (I guess) Greek. Whereas, the modern dictionaries leave out the painful connotations: "a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations."

It took a bit of artful Googling to find this: "*The word 'nostalgia' is a compound of nostos and the Greek word algos, which means pain'. It literally means the suffering caused by the desire to return to one's place of origin.*"

Which is not to kick The South. But, it is to acknowledge that the American ethos toward individuals allows people to forgive, and even support again, a person who publicly acknowledges (and does not deny) their offenses against others and swears to do better (viz: Robert Downey, Jr.). Hell, some Americans will go out of their way to root him on, despite the things he has done in the past to hurt other people.

I do not know if anybody can lay claim to that belief. I do believe it is American as a whole.
