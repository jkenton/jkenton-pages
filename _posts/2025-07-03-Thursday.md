Rage Against the Machine - *Bulls on Parade*

*Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes* <br />
*Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal* <br />
*I walk the corner to the rubble that used to be a library* <br />
*Line up to the mind cemetery now* <br />
*What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'* <br />
*They don't gotta burn the books they just remove 'em* <br />
*While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells* <br />
*Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells* <br />
