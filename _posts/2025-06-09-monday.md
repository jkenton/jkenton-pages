Bob Marley - *Three Little Birds*

I've been visited by at least two specters in the last 24 hours. Once from a long-deceased former therapist, once from a person in my life currently. Both of them were trying in their own way to help me see that my fears are worse than reality ever could be.

I've never been good at trumpeting my own cause, but I am sincere and I always do my best. Sometimes, my sincerity appears like uncaring or aloofness. There are some people who have understood me, and they are out there. I don't have to please everyone. 

Get out there and be the best you that you can be!
