[JMK: Lest it seem like I am criticizing the Swiss military for their decision to scrap the "delta" planes I mentioned in the video for the F-5 Tigers, I am not. I am criticizing the Military-Industrial Complex for making it seem like a country like Switzerland COULD defend itself in an all-out attack by a Superpower aggressor. Switzerland is a very small country and doesn't have the natural resources that other countries have (and are targeted for). A beautiful country, though. Just - perhaps - the populace there is driven more by existential fear than by common sense.]
