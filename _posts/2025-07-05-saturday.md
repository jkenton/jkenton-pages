What is meant by "Revolution will not be Televised"

JMK: You can't change things until you change yourself. And you can't change yourself until you come to terms with your thoughts and actions; How they reflect on yourself, how they affect others. Maybe dear Gil had it right when he said that Black people worked the process more than other groups of people. It's not the first time I've heard it described that way.
