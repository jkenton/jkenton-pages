When I was a kid, there was a weatherman on Channel 11 out of Sioux Falls, SD. His name was Dave something. He also had a kid's show in the afternoon called "Captain 11". I offer this context so it is easier to find THE weatherman named Dave who worked at Channel 11 in Sioux Falls, SD in the late 1970s. In any event, it was alleged that Mr. Dave (i just made that name up now. I don't think anyone called him that then.) used to enjoy a couple of adult beverages before work. See the movie "Anchorman" for some analogous context. In any further event... he also had a way of mixing in some interesting comments during his weather forecasts. On one particular day, he said it was going to get bitter cold, so a wise viewer would do well to "bring in your brass monkey." I ONLY say this because last night would have been such a night. If we were in the Channel 11 viewing area. And if Dave were still alive. Which is about 200 words more than was necessary to say "It's really cold out there today."

*ex post facto backfilling: His name was Dave Dedrick, and the [Captain 11](https://www.keloland.com/captain-11/) show was on the air from 1955 to 1996. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_11) The closest I can get to a confirmation of my story about Brass Monkeys is [this private blog](https://littlebitofsouthdakota.blogspot.com/2011/02/colder-than-brass-monkey.html) (which als has a gaggle of helpful cold day recipes for your reading or cooking enjoyment). Dave (March 29, 1928 - January 22, 2010) was a pioneer on the airwaves in South Dakota.*
