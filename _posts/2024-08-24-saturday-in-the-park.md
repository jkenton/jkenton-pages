This song reminds me of many afternoons listening to my dad's LPs on their portable record player. These were songs that weren't on the radio. Lou Rawls, Herb Alpert, Johnny Mathis, Ray Charles, etc. I can't recall a Bill Withers album in there, but it would certainly have fit in... 

*Can you dig it? Yes, I can!*
