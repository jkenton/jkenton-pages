[The Magic Flatulence Post at the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/for-this-visionary-artist-farts-are-the-greatest-inspiration_n_578d2648e4b0a0ae97c2f1dd)

The American Visionary Arts Museum is located on the south edge of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Among other things, a person can see a larger than life mannequin of Divine, an Icarus falling from the top of the Atrium, a rendering of the *Lusitania* made from toothpicks, and one of the most epic gift shops any denizen of Arts museums will appreciate. In the basement, there is also a grand epic to the humble flatus. I tried to make the embedded short in such a way that the viewer can pause and make out what each element of the collage is trying to say/achieve. Suitable for watching over and over. Also, the Post is not limited to just ONE expression of flatulence, though one is all I could capture at a time. Enjoy.
