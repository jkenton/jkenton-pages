Moments after this video was recorded, I decided to lay back down. Bam... an hour later I am awake again! I feel better about almost everything!---

Van Halen - *Panama*

This morning, I wanted to reverse some of the disconnectedness I felt yesterday. So I sat down to track out the day. I have a "personalized" workout plan through Peloton, and I wanted to write down the "shape" of it so I could look forward, rather than being reminded in the afternoon that I still need to do one.

I opened the Peloton app to find that there was no longer a section on the app that showed those workouts. I couldn't see any way to even tell that I was enrolled in such a thing... I broke down and contacted Peloton support. The support person was mystified... giving me directions to "if you see this, then click that"... Nothing was working. I was losing interest in the whole enterprise.

Then, the support person said "Oh, wait... there is an outage." I thanked them for trying... Gonna go back to bed. So I did, and fell asleep for an hour. Woke up in a better mood, and the "personalized" workouts are back on my Peloton app.

Sometimes, the early bird gets the worm. The bird that arrives on time gets the fatter, less activated worms. Show up on time.
