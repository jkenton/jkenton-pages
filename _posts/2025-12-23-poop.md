Sometimes, things get messed up, ya know?

2025-12-23 19:38:41 - I think I fixed it. The issue was that a couple of files had the YAML frontmatter getting stepped on by the first line of new content. Adding some carriage returns in the proper places seemed to do the trick. How can a person see which files might have YAML problems?
