From a call-out on https://www.peets.com/products/major-dickasons:

> Major Dickason's Blend
> Major Dickason's is the stuff of legends. A bold blend of the finest Latin American and Indo-pacific beans suggested by loyal customer Key Dickason and perfected by Mr. Peet. Darkly roasted and deeply loved, it’s our all-time best seller. Majorly satisfying, every time.
