I had a dream about my dog Toby (2016-2022), a big ole mastiff boy. He was the best boy. Miss him every day. In the dream, I was taking W and S for a walk to drain their bladders and whatnot. And suddenly, Toby appeared in the doorway so I invited him along too. He did his spin dance and I was very happy. 

HAPPY NOVEMBERTEENTH!!
