Sly and the Fmaily Stone - *Everyday People*

From Adam Savage's Tested YouTube Channel:

*Um my wife is a marriage and family therapist and uh one of her special research tracks has been trauma, reasons for trauma, mitigations for trauma, etc. But at one point in the study of trauma, she came up came across this amazing definition which was: <br/><br/>**A traumatic experience is one in which the veil is pull pulled aside about how little you matter.**<br/><br/>How little we matter, how little the universe cares about us. We live in this pleasant fiction where we say goodbye to our partners every morning and we see them every evening and we see our families a few times a year and stuff like that. We know intellectually that all that could go in a heartbeat but there's a difference between knowing that and having it happen to you. And when it happens to you you I think one of the parts of grief is realizing that you know the universe does not care about your puny soul and that is difficult.*
