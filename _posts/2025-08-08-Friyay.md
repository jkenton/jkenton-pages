Van Halen - *Dreams*

---
I saw Van Halen play in their "Van Hagar" configuration and it was a great show. But the songs they recorded in the Van Hagar period are not ones that I would think of first when I think of Van Halen. Not better or worse, just not what first comes to mind.

Van Halen - *Humans Being*

---

The movie Twister was partially shot in and around Ames, IA. During that summer, I was working as a housekeeper at the Ramada on South Duff (no longer exists). That hotel was the host for several of the actors who were in the movie *Twister*. That is my relationship to this Van Hagar song.
