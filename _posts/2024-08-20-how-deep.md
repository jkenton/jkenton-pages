<pre>
I know your eyes in the morning sun  
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain  
And the moment that you wander far from me  
I wanna feel you in my arms again  
And you come to me on a summer breeze  
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave  
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me

I believe in you  
You know the door to my very soul  
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour  
You're my savior when I fall  
And you may not think I care for you  
When you know down inside that I really do  
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me

Na-na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

And you come to me on a summer breeze  
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave  
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me (na-na-na-na-na)

How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me (na-na-na-na-na)

How deep is your love?  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me
