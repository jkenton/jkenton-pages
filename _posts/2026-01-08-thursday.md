### A peek behind the curtain

This space was reserved for a song called "Killing an Arab" by the Cure. Alas, my rule is to only link to videos that were released by the band's official channel. I can only find a rendition that includes an entire album (yes from the band's official channel). I chose to not link to a 1 hour file. Please understand.
