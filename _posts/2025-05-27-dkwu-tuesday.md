Can't you tell that they secretly deep down are envious / jealous / admiring each other? I bet there were physical altercations in the past. Perhaps even battery! There is a moment where Sting looks at Stewart with a bemused expression. 

That expression reminds me of one that Tom Petty gave Prince when Prince put a huge solo on George Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Look for it below, around 4:40-5:10. (You know in the fullness of time, I can see that they are both in on it, and nobody is upset with each other; in either case...)
